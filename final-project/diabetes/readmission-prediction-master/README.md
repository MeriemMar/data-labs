# Hospital Readmission Prediction using ML techniques
This repo contains the final version of our project to identify determinants of, and predict hospital readmission in diabetic patients. The repo contains all data input files, Jupyter notebooks containing pre-processing code and modeling, as well as final output files produced. The dataset used is publicly available [here at UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes).
